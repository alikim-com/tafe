### Features:
 - Drawing objects with Drag & Drop support on PictureBox control

> Download files from [the repository](https://github.com/alikim-com/tafe/tree/main/programming/EventExplorer/WinFormsApp1) and compile your own executable.

 - For a better outlook of the event diagram, load the following layout via menu:<br/> `Load` > `Layout collection` > `View One`
