A BOTTLE IN SPACE

"They found a bottle in space. Opening it was their first mistake."


Version 1: "The Lucky Break"
The crew of the Stardust Minnow is on a routine patrol when they detect an unusual signal. Captain Jax, intrigued but cautious, orders Luna to scan for potential threats. As they approach, they find a gigantic bottle floating in space. Vort calculates the odds of this occurrence, declaring it "highly improbable."
Jax decides to retrieve the bottle, much to Luna's excitement and Vort's hesitation. Once aboard, they discover a message claiming they've won a galactic lottery. Luna is ecstatic, already planning upgrades for the ship. Jax is skeptical but allows himself a moment of hope.
As they debate whether to trust the message, Vort detects an incoming ship. It's revealed to be a reality show crew, explaining that the bottle was part of an intergalactic prank show. The twist: while the lottery win isn't real, the Stardust Minnow crew are now viral sensations, earning them a modest but much-needed paycheck.
The episode ends with Jax reluctantly embracing their newfound fame, Luna excitedly planning minor ship improvements, and Vort attempting to understand the concept of practical jokes.
