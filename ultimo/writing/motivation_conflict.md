### Engineer: 
Luna Cole
> Motivation:
- Luna is driven by her passion for breathing life into machines and her need to prove her worth despite
her lack of formal education. Her motivation manifests externally in her tireless efforts to keep the ship running
with limited resources, while internally fueling her quest to find beauty and purpose in the mechanics
of their dangerous lifestyle.
> Conflict:
- Luna's main conflict stems from the clash between her optimistic worldview and the harsh realities of their
precarious existence. Externally, she fights against the constant breakdowns and limitations of their outdated
equipment, while internally struggling to maintain her cheerful demeanor and faith in people in the face of
the crew's often morally ambiguous choices.

### Navigator: Vort
> Motivation:
- Vort's core motivation is to transcend the limitations of his robotic nature and achieve a state as close
to human as possible. Externally, this drives him to excel in his role as the ship's navigator, constantly improving
his skills and usefulness to the crew. Internally, it pushes him to study and mimic human behavior, seeking
to understand and replicate the nuances of human emotion and interaction.

> Conflict:
- Vort's primary conflict arises from the fundamental dichotomy between his robotic nature and his aspiration
to be human. Externally, this manifests in occasional glitches or misinterpretations of complex human situations,
potentially jeopardizing the crew's missions. Internally, he grapples with the existential question of whether
true humanity is achievable for an artificial being, and whether his growing emulation of human traits is genuine
or merely sophisticated programming.
