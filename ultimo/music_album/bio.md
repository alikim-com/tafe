Aria Nova, born Skylar Chen in 2002, is an emerging electronic music artist known for her dreamy vocals and atmospheric synthwave production. Growing up in Seattle, Aria was influenced by the city's vibrant indie music scene and her parents' collection of 80s new wave records.

At 19, Aria began producing tracks in her bedroom studio, blending retro synth sounds with modern electronic elements. Her unique style caught the attention of indie label Neon Horizon Records, leading to her first EP release in 2023.

Aria's debut full-length album, "Cosmic Wanderer," dropped in early 2024 to critical acclaim. The 10-track collection showcases her signature blend of shimmering synths, pulsing beats, and ethereal vocals. Standout singles like "Stardust Dreams" and "Neon Nostalgia" have garnered millions of streams, establishing Aria Nova as a rising star in the electronic synthwave scene.

Now 22, Aria is preparing for her first national tour, bringing her cosmic soundscapes to audiences across the country. With her innovative approach to blending retro and contemporary electronic styles, Aria Nova is poised to become a defining voice in the next wave of chill synthwave artists.
