Soft wind chimes, gradually rising
Gentle flowing water, soft piano notes
Delicate harp glissandos, subtle shimmer effects
Birds chirping, distant waves
Metamorphosis sound - crystalline tingles
Single pure tone, like a singing bowl
Rustling leaves, distant thunder becoming wind chimes
Ethereal choir notes
Ascending wind tones, reverberating metal
Gentle waves, distant seabirds
Rising orchestral swell, wind through feathers
Rushing air becoming wind chimes
Forest ambiance, distant bell tones
White noise dissolving into crystalline chimes
